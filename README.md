# Svelte GJS

This is a demo of how to create GTK apps using Svelte and GJS.

There's a blog post explaining how it works [here](https://hjkl.rocks/blog/svelte-gtk).

## How to run

You need to have GJS installed on your system. On Arch, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gjs
```

Then, you can run the app with:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
